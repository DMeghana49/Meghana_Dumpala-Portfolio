I am an undergraduate student at Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering (Autonomous), 
pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
 I come from Andhra Pradesh, India, and Telugu is my native language. However, I am fluent in both English and Hindi.
At present, I am actively exploring my technical niche and continuously expanding my knowledge.
 Python and Java hold a special place in my heart as my preferred programming languages. 
 My career aspirations lie in the field of Machine Learning. Additionally, I possess intermediate-level skills 
 in frontend development and have a strong command of Java programming.

I derive great pleasure from unleashing my creativity. I have a knack for problem-solving, 
and I approach everything with a logical mindset. Coding and browsing the web are among my favorite activities. 
Manipulating and finding patterns in numbers is something I thoroughly enjoy. When I'm not engrossed in these activities,
 you can find me indulging in my favorite hobbies of watching movies and reading thrilling novels.
